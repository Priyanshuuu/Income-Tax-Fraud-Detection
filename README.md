# Income-Tax Fraud Detection

## Description
* In many scenarios, tax payers must declare the amount according to the tax base in some process and pay a percentage of that amount.
* This implies that many tax payers under-report earnings to reduce their taxes, as they have no incentive to report the actual amount.
* What this project contains a web-app based api that uses *Unsupervised methodology* to detect and score tax payers under-reporting their tax base in order to pay less taxes than they should.
